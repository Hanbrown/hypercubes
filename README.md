## Hypercubes and Coloring Graphs
_By Dr. S. Krehbiel, Dr. H. Levinson, and Pranav Rao_

 This project studies the properties of coloring graphs with a goal of creating a visualization tool specifically for visualizing the related cube complexes.  The hope is that this alternate visualization will yield additional insight into some properties (such as biconnectivity).
